People/customers can rate the store based on how easy it is to find items, the quality of items 
(you can get sued for bad items after breakage in shipping or for being on shelves for to long).

There is a delivery servivce which can deliver items to customers. We can charge them OR give it for free but
no shipping-handling.

There will be adveritisements which you buy to increase the amount of customers going to your store
but this can also make it harder to keep a stock of items which will give you bad rates. You can buy billbourds, digital ads, posters, and parking.

You can also upgrade parking space.  (Mabye)
