This is how React will look like in the project, for the most part
If you don't like it we can roll back these changes...


I'd probably simplify HTML more and just leave one root element, and add all the other stuff to React too


We could delete the pages/game folder
I kinda added all that into public

We could also make pages/menu naviagtable in react and then remove this as well?
